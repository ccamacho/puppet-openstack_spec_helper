features:
  - Added a new facts module that can be pulled in by the other
    puppet modules to be able to manage the inclusion of
    rspec-puppet-facts and the related default facts in a single
    inclusion.
other:
  - Require a minimum of rspec-puppet-facts 1.7.0 due to the addition
    of the add_custom_fact function which was not available until this
    version.
